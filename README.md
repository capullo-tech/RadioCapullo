# RadioCapullo

## Overview
This is a free and open source Android application with music broadcast and listen dual modes.

**RadioCapullo** creates an atmospheric music environment running in multiple android devices in a star topology. 
All listeners play the music at exactly the same time, increasing the overall volume and the depth of field.


## Features
- **Dual Functionality**: Functions as both a Snapserver and Snapclient.
- **Spotify Integration**: Streams Spotify content via librespot-java.
- **Multiroom Audio Sync**: Ensures synchronized playback across multiple devices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open with Android Studio.
3. Build and install on your Android device.

## Architecture
### App Components
It integrates Snapcast's multiroom audio streaming with librespot-java, enabling devices to act both as an audio source and receiver within a multiroom setup. This app transforms any Android device into a Spotify speaker using Zeroconf for device discovery.

#### Audio Processing and Broadcasting
RadioCapullo utilizes librespot-java to handle Spotify integration, allowing the server device to function as a Spotify speaker. The audio output from librespot-java is directed into a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue, which effectively manages the audio data stream. Snapserver then accesses this FIFO as its input source for broadcasting the audio across the network.

#### Server Playback
Simultaneously, the server device also acts as a Snapclient. It plays the same music it is broadcasting, ensuring that it can both stream and participate in the synchronized multiroom audio experience. This dual functionality allows for real-time monitoring and enjoyment of the streamed content directly on the server device.

These processes ensure a cohesive and synchronized streaming experience across all connected devices within the network, adhering to the principles of fair use and respecting Spotify's terms of service.

### Use case Scenarios
```
Gathered with friends but no loudspeaker?
What if everyone's phone could play in unison. 
Can you imagine what happens if you place the phones around-away from you?
```

1. **Server as a Broadcast and Playback Unit**: 
   - The Android device operates as a server using the `Server Control UI` to manage audio capture and processing through a `FIFO Queue`.
   - It employs `librespot-java` for Spotify integration, appearing on the network via Zeroconf.
   - As a Snapserver, it broadcasts the audio across the network.
   - Simultaneously, it acts as its own Snapclient, playing the broadcasted audio locally for immediate feedback and ensuring the audio is in sync.

2. **Clients Receiving Broadcast**:
   - Multiple client devices connect to the server.
   - Each client uses its `Client Control UI` to tune into the server's broadcast.
   - Audio is output through each client's speakers, synchronized across all devices via Snapclient, ensuring uniform multiroom audio playback.

These scenarios illustrate how RadioCapullo facilitates a comprehensive audio streaming experience, allowing devices to serve as both sources and receivers in a synchronized audio environment. This setup enhances the flexibility and usability of home audio systems.
