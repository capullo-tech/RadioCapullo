# RadioCapullo

## Overview
This is a free and open source Android application with music broadcast and listen dual modes.

**RadioCapullo** creates an atmospheric music environment running in multiple android devices in a star topology. 
All listeners play the music at exactly the same time, increasing the overall volume and the depth of field.


## Features
- **Dual Functionality**: Functions as both a Snapserver and Snapclient.
- **Spotify Integration**: Streams Spotify content via librespot-java.
- **Multiroom Audio Sync**: Ensures synchronized playback across multiple devices.

#### Audio Processing and Broadcasting
RadioCapullo utilizes librespot-java to handle Spotify integration, allowing the server device to function as a Spotify speaker. This app transforms any Android device into a Spotify speaker using Zeroconf for device discovery. The audio output from librespot-java is directed into a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue, which effectively manages the audio data stream. Snapserver then accesses this FIFO as its input source for broadcasting the audio across the network.

#### Server Playback
Simultaneously, the server device also acts as a Snapclient. It plays the same music it is broadcasting, ensuring that it can both stream and participate in the synchronized multiroom audio experience. This dual functionality allows for real-time monitoring and enjoyment of the streamed content directly on the server device.

These processes ensure a cohesive and synchronized streaming experience across all connected devices within the network, adhering to the principles of fair use and respecting Spotify's terms of service.

## Use case Scenarios

- Gathered with friends but no loudspeaker?
- What if everyone's phone could play in unison. 
- Can you imagine what happens if you place the phones around-away from you?

These scenarios illustrate how RadioCapullo facilitates a comprehensive audio streaming experience, allowing devices to serve as both sources and receivers in a synchronized audio environment.
